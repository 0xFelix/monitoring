# KubeVirt Dashboards

[Grafana](http://grafana.com/) dashboards shipped with the KubeVirt stack are located in this directory.

Once you have your Prometheus setup running and Grafana data source that connects to it, these dashboards can be imported to Grafana.

It is also possible to save the files using the [Grafana provisioning](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/) feature.

> Note that your Grafana database or the provisioning files should be saved to a persistent storage.
